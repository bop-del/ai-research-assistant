# Article Analysis

## Overview

Transforms web articles into searchable Obsidian notes with personalized suggestions. Extracts article content, generates summaries connecting insights to your work priorities, and creates structured reference material.

## When to Use

- Analyzing blog posts or newsletter articles for insights
- Extracting key learnings from industry publications
- Processing research into knowledge base
- Building searchable reference library from web content
- Need personalized suggestions connecting article to work priorities

## Input

**Required:** Article URL as argument
```
/article https://stratechery.com/article-name
```

**Optional:** Add context or specific questions after the URL
```
/article https://stratechery.com/article-name What does this say about AI strategy?
```

## Vault Configuration

**Vault Root:** Your Obsidian vault (accessed via MCP)
**Interest Profile:** `interest-profile.md`
**Output Folder:** `Clippings/`

## Workflow

### 1. Extract Article Content

Use WebFetch tool to retrieve and parse the article:

```
WebFetch URL with prompt: "Extract the full article content including title, author, publication date, and body text. Return as structured text."
```

**Fallback for complex pages:** If WebFetch fails, try trafilatura via Python:

```bash
pip3 install trafilatura 2>/dev/null
python3 << 'EXTRACT_EOF'
import trafilatura
import json

url = "ARTICLE_URL"
downloaded = trafilatura.fetch_url(url)
result = trafilatura.extract(downloaded, include_comments=False, include_tables=True,
                              output_format='json', with_metadata=True)
if result:
    data = json.loads(result)
    print(f"Title: {data.get('title', 'Unknown')}")
    print(f"Author: {data.get('author', 'Unknown')}")
    print(f"Date: {data.get('date', 'Unknown')}")
    print(f"Source: {data.get('sitename', 'Unknown')}")
    print("---CONTENT---")
    print(data.get('text', ''))
else:
    print("ERROR: Could not extract article content")
EXTRACT_EOF
```

### 2. Load Work Context

Before generating analysis, load context for personalized suggestions:

```
obsidian:read_note path="interest-profile.md"
```

**Key context to extract:**
- **Work section**: Role, company, team size, current priorities, professional interests
- **Private section**: Personal interests, life context, hobbies

### 3. Generate Analysis

Based on the article content and work context, generate:

#### Management Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Main topic and thesis of the article
- Key argument or insight
- Target audience and value proposition

#### Key Findings (5-10 bullet points)
- Most important insights
- Actionable takeaways
- Notable quotes or claims
- Counterintuitive or contrarian ideas

#### Suggestions

**For HeyJobs** (3-5 bullets):
Connect article insights to the user's role and priorities from `interest-profile.md`. Consider how the content applies to their:
- Current role and responsibilities (CPO at jobs marketplace)
- Product strategy and growth challenges
- AI/ML applications and analytics
- Team and organizational leadership
- Monetization and business models

**For Me Personally** (3-5 bullets):
Connect to the user's personal interests from `interest-profile.md`. Consider applications for:
- Personal development and learning
- PKM and productivity systems
- Hobbies and side projects
- Tools and techniques to explore

#### Relevance Section (if user provided questions)
- How the article relates to user's specific interests
- Direct answers to any questions asked

### 4. Auto-Generate Source Slug

Generate tag-friendly slug from URL domain:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse
domain = urlparse(url).netloc
domain = domain.removeprefix("www.")
name = domain.rsplit(".", 1)[0]
slug = name.replace(".", "-").replace("_", "-").lower()
```

Examples:
- `www.lennysnewsletter.com` → `lennysnewsletter`
- `stratechery.com` → `stratechery`
- `review.firstround.com` → `review-firstround`
- `oneusefulthing.substack.com` → `oneusefulthing-substack`

### 5. Save to Obsidian

**Output Path:** `Clippings/{Sanitized Title}.md`

Sanitize title: remove special characters, replace spaces with hyphens, truncate to 80 chars.

**CRITICAL:** The `url` field in frontmatter and the URL in Metadata section MUST be the EXACT input URL provided by the user. Do NOT regenerate, retype, or modify the URL in any way. Copy it character-for-character.

#### File Structure

```markdown
---
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [type/reference, area/learning, status/inbox, source/{source_slug}]
url: {EXACT input URL - copy verbatim, do not retype}
source: {Article URL}
author: "[[{Author Name}]]"
---

# {Article Title}

## Metadata
- **Source:** {publication/site name}
- **Author:** {author}
- **Published:** {formatted date}
- **URL:** {EXACT input URL - copy verbatim from user input}

## Management Summary

{2-3 paragraph summary of the article content, main thesis, and value}

## Key Findings

- {finding 1}
- {finding 2}
- {finding 3}
...

## Suggestions

### For HeyJobs
- {suggestion connecting insight to product strategy/growth}
- {suggestion for team/product organization}
- {suggestion for AI/analytics/monetization priorities}

### For Me Personally
- {personal learning or leadership suggestion}
- {PKM or productivity application}
- {tool, technique, or trend to explore}

## Relevance to Your Questions

{Only include if user provided specific questions or context}

## Original Content

> [!info]- Full Article Text
> {Full article text in collapsed callout for searchability}
```

## Content Length Strategy

| Word Count | Approach |
|------------|----------|
| < 2000 | **Standard**: Full analysis, complete text in callout |
| 2000-5000 | **Standard**: Full analysis, complete text in callout |
| > 5000 | **Summary mode**: Analysis + key excerpts only |

## Important Rules

1. **Always load interest profile** – Read `interest-profile.md` before analysis
2. **Handle extraction failures gracefully** – Clear error message with suggestions
3. **Sanitize filenames** – Remove `/ \ : * ? " < > |` from titles
4. **Create folder structure** – Ensure `Clippings/` exists
5. **Use Obsidian MCP** – Write output using `obsidian:write_note` tool
6. **Include full text** – Store in collapsed callout for search
7. **Auto-generate source slug** – Don't rely on manual mapping
8. **NEVER modify URLs** – Copy the input URL exactly as provided. Do not retype URLs from memory or regenerate them. URLs contain dates and identifiers that must be preserved exactly.

## Error Handling

**Paywalled content:**
```
This article appears to be behind a paywall.

Extracted what was available:
- Title: {title}
- Excerpt: {available excerpt}

Options:
1. If you have access, copy/paste the article text
2. Check if there's an RSS feed with full content
3. Skip this article
```

**JavaScript-rendered page:**
```
Could not extract article content (page may require JavaScript).

Options:
1. Try a different URL for the same article
2. Copy/paste the article text manually
3. Use a reader-mode URL if available
```

**Network error:**

Please check:
- URL is correct and publicly accessible

```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Paywalled content | Falls back to excerpt; inform user |
| Missing interest-profile.md | Create profile in vault root first |
| JavaScript-rendered pages | Note limitation; suggest alternatives |
| Very long articles | Use summary mode for >5000 words |

## Example Usage

```
/article https://stratechery.com/2024/some-article-name
```

```
