- Want structured summaries instead of reading full articles

## Quick Reference

| With questions | `/article URL What does this say about X?` | Analysis + relevance section |
| Long article (>5000 words) | Automatic | Summary mode |

**Output location:** `Clippings/`

## Process Summary

1. Extract article content using WebFetch or trafilatura
2. Load interest-profile.md for context
3. Generate analysis (summary, findings, suggestions)

## Common Mistakes
